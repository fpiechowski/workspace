# Integrated summaries (I4 and I5)

Both the I4 and I5 implementation tasks committed a summary to this shared root
path (`work-products/SUMMARY.md`). Merging I5 onto the I4 lineage conflicted on
the whole file; both summaries are preserved verbatim below.

# I4 — Orchestrator guidance and documentation

Status: implemented and committed (`c718ed1`).

## What changed

- **Binary-owned autonomous notice.** `autonomyRunNotice` (`internal/core/autonomy.go`)
  is appended to an orchestrator Run prompt while `autonomy.state=running`
  (`internal/core/session.go`). It carries the §3.3 judgment rules and the §4
  user-reserved boundary, so it survives stale or customized project templates.
- **Templates.** `orchestrator.AGENTS.md.tmpl` gains an `{{if .Autonomous}}`
  branch (interactive text becomes the `{{else}}`); the plan-first and manual
  `WORKFLOW.md.tmpl` / `prompts/orchestrator.md.tmpl` gain short autonomy notes.
  `Workspace.Autonomous()` and `promptData.Autonomous` back the switch, and
  `create --autonomous` now sets the record before templates are snapshotted.
- **Stale detection.** The previous stock plan-first workflow and orchestrator
  prompt digests are added to the stale lists in `internal/core/project.go`.
- **Skill.** The bundled `SKILL.md` (and its identical `.agents` copy) document
  `--autonomous`, the `decision_required` autonomous clause, and the
  `workspace autonomy enable|disable|report` commands. `workspace prime` prints
  them.
- **Docs.** `PRODUCT.md` (principle + scope), `README.md` (flag, commands,
  report), `ARCHITECTURE.md` (Domain Model + persisted state), `docs/operations.md`
  (mutations, `autonomy_excluded`, rationale receipts), `docs/runtime.md`
  (delivery precondition, run end).

## Verification

- gofmt clean, `go vet ./...` clean, `go test ./... -count=1` green.
- `go test ./internal/core -run 'Session|Skill|Template|Autonomy' -count=1` green.
- `WORKSPACE_TMUX_TEST=1 go test -race ./internal/core -run
  'Session|Skill|Template|Autonomy' -timeout 120s` green (22.5s, no data race).
- Doc link check: `checked=29 broken=0`.
- New tests: `internal/core/autonomy_prompt_test.go`.

The exact ``WORKSPACE_TMUX_TEST=1 go test -race ./... -timeout 90s`` is red on
this machine for pre-existing reasons (terminal pseudo-TTY test fails at
unmodified HEAD `58b5862`; the core race binary exceeds 90s here). See
`work-products/IMPLEMENTATION.md` and `work-products/CHECKS-I4.yaml`.

# Summary — task_01M3MJYS3TAP3E9057R289DR1G (I5: TUI support)

Implemented PLAN.md §5-I5: the TUI surface for autonomous workspaces.

- The workspace header shows an autonomy badge (`● autonomous running`,
  `✓ autonomous delivered`, `○ autonomous disabled`); the state word survives
  `--no-color`.
- A delivered report is a Needs-attention row (and a More entry) that opens a
  report view with the outcome, recommendation, integration head, artifact IDs
  and pending commands.
- Decisions resolved under autonomy are marked `by orchestrator (autonomous)`
  and their detail exposes the subject, evidence and Run provenance.
- The Orchestrator, Runtime and Autonomy pages offer a guarded
  `Disable autonomous run`: a required reason, a confirmation that keeps the
  exact current revision and the `tui_<ULID>` key, dispatched to
  `Service.DisableAutonomy`. Disabled workspaces no longer offer it.
- The TUI does not offer `autonomy enable` on an existing workspace (A4) and
  never auto-accepts handoffs or decisions. The create-form `Autonomous run`
  toggle reaches `CreateOptions.Autonomous` for both the named workflow and the
  manual choice.
- `docs/tui.md` documents all of the above.

Commit `eca7ab5`. Checks (`work-products/CHECKS-I5.yaml`): `go test
./internal/tui -count=1`, gofmt, `go vet ./...` and the full `go test ./...`
all pass (full suite with the harness `WORKSPACE_*` variables cleared, matching
the I3 checks file).
